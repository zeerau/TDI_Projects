## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning a dataset of used cars sourced from Kaggle's "Craigslist Cars and Trucks Data" repository. The primary goal is to preprocess the data, handle missing values, detect and treat outliers, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling. The project also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about the dataset.

## Process
The project follows a structured approach to data cleaning and analysis:
1. **Data Acquisition**: The dataset was downloaded using the `kagglehub` library.
2. **Data Inspection**: The dataset was inspected for missing values, data types, and overall structure using Pandas.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Irrelevant columns such as `url`, `region_url`, and `image_url` were dropped.
   - Missing values were analyzed using hypothesis testing and correlation analysis to determine their impact on the target variable (`price`).
   - Missing values were imputed using strategies like mean, mode, KNN, or iterative imputation based on the percentage of missingness.
4. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**:
   - Outliers in numerical columns like `price` and `mileage` were treated using methods such as capping, Z-score filtering, and log transformations.
5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - New features were created, such as missing value indicators and transformed variables (e.g., log-transformed `price`).
6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations like boxplots were created to analyze the distribution of `price` across manufacturers.
7. **Data Transformation**:
   - Columns were converted to appropriate data types (e.g., `year` and `posting_date` were converted to datetime).
8. **Final Dataset Preparation**: The cleaned and transformed dataset was saved for further analysis or modeling.

## Tech Tools
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For imputation and preprocessing.
- **Scipy**: For statistical analysis.
- **Kagglehub**: For downloading the dataset.

## Conclusion
The project successfully cleaned and prepared the dataset for further analysis. Missing values were handled effectively, outliers were treated, and the dataset was transformed into a format suitable for machine learning or statistical modeling. Key insights, such as the distribution of car prices across manufacturers, were visualized. This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data cleaning and preprocessing.
