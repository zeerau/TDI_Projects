# README

## Introduction
The **TDI Projects** repository is a comprehensive collection of data analysis and machine learning projects. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. The projects span various domains, including wine reviews, Netflix data analysis, and crop yield prediction. Each project is structured to demonstrate the application of data science techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Process
The workflow for these projects followed a structured approach:
1. **Data Collection**: Raw datasets were sourced from various domains, such as wine reviews and Netflix titles.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled, and data was standardized using techniques like removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and eliminating stopwords.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key insights were derived by visualizing and summarizing the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: New features were created, such as categorizing wine quality based on ratings or extracting lead actors from Netflix data.
5. **Modeling**: For machine learning tasks, models were trained and evaluated to make predictions or classifications.
6. **Documentation**: Each step was documented in Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility and clarity.

## Tech Tools
The following tools and libraries were utilized:
- **Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and transformation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and stopword removal.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive coding and documentation.
- **Google Colab**: For running notebooks in a cloud environment.

## Conclusion
The projects in this repository showcase the application of data science techniques to diverse datasets. Key outcomes include:
- Cleaning and transforming raw data into usable formats.
- Extracting meaningful insights through EDA.
- Building predictive models for specific tasks like crop yield prediction.
- Demonstrating the use of NLP techniques for text analysis.
